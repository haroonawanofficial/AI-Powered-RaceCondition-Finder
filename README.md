## Overview

The **Advanced URL Race Condition Scanner** is a powerful tool designed for the detection of potential race conditions in web applications by sending concurrent requests to URLs and analyzing their responses for inconsistencies. It's particularly useful for testing web applications to identify vulnerabilities, unexpected behavior, or data corruption caused by concurrent requests.

## Key Features

- **Race Condition Detection**: The tool identifies potential race conditions by sending multiple requests to a URL or a list of URLs and analyzing differences in their responses.

- **Web Application Testing**: Use this tool to uncover concurrent request-related issues in web applications, allowing you to proactively address vulnerabilities.

- **Automated Testing**: Automate the process of sending concurrent requests and analyzing responses, improving efficiency and reliability in your testing.

- **Information Gathering**: By detecting potential race conditions, you gain valuable insights into areas of your web application that may require further testing or code improvements to ensure consistent and reliable behavior.

- **Database and Reporting**: The tool offers storage of extracted URLs in a SQLite database for in-depth analysis and generates reports to document results.

## Potential Impact of Race Conditions

- **Data Corruption**: Race conditions can lead to data corruption, potentially resulting in data loss or incorrect application behavior.

- **Resource Conflicts**: In web applications, race conditions can trigger resource conflicts, such as multiple users simultaneously accessing or modifying resources, leading to unpredictable behavior and application crashes.

- **Inconsistent States**: Race conditions can cause applications to enter inconsistent states. Concurrent actions may be processed in unintended orders, leading to unexpected application states.

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Some race conditions can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access or privileges within an application, potentially compromising security.

- **Application Crashes**: When not properly handled, race conditions can cause application crashes. Simultaneous access to shared resources may lead to conflicts and application instability.

## Usage

You can run the tool by providing a list of target URLs or domains using command-line arguments. It will then test these URLs for potential race conditions and store extracted URLs in a SQLite database. 

```bash
python advanced_race_condition_scanner.py -l urls.txt -o results.db
